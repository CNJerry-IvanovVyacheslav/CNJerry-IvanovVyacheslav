### Hello everyone, my name is Viacheslav Ivanov. I am currently looking for a job as an Android developer.

At the moment, I have 5 completed applications in my portfolio and 1 project in development:
- [KotlinCalculator](https://github.com/CNJerry-IvanovVyacheslav/KotlinCalculator) - a classic calculator written in Kotlin. It all started here.
- [Playlist Maker](https://github.com/CNJerry-IvanovVyacheslav/Playlist_Maker) - my first full-fledged project on the Android developer course from Яндекс.Практикум. It works as an application for creating playlists and listening to music.
- [practicum-android-diploma](https://github.com/CNJerry-IvanovVyacheslav/practicum-android-diploma) - graduation project on the course "Android developer". We did it in a team of 4 people. It works as an api-based job aggregator hh.ru
- [Get Away](https://github.com/CNJerry-IvanovVyacheslav/Get_Away) - a game inspired by Wappo. I decided to implement it on Jetpack Compose
- [AndroidDev Daily Quiz](https://github.com/CNJerry-IvanovVyacheslav/AndroidDev_Daily_Quiz) - an app for daily practice and improvement of Android development skills
- [Not for Goblins](https://github.com/CNJerry-IvanovVyacheslav/Not_for_Goblins) - a 2D Tower Defense for Android with Roguelite elements
